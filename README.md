Rental bikes are being introduced in urban cities to improve mobility and convenience. Ensuring the timely availability of bikes is crucial to minimize waiting time and maintain a stable supply. The key challenge lies in accurately predicting the required bike count for each hour to meet demand. This prediction enables effective management and optimization of rental bike services.
Rental bikes are now available in many cities to improve convenience and mobility. It is important to ensure that rental bikes are always accessible to the public when they need them, reducing waiting times. One of the main challenges is predicting how many bikes will be needed at each hour to maintain a consistent supply. This prediction helps ensure that the city has enough rental bikes available at all times to meet the demand.

Challenges in predicting demand for bicycles:

 As urban mobility patterns are dynamic and complex, forecasting demand for bicycles in rental services presents several challenges, and understanding and addressing these challenges will require developing accurate forecasting models. important to The biggest challenges are:

 1. Seasonality and time-based fluctuations: Demand for bicycles often exhibits large fluctuations based on time of day, day of week, and seasonal patterns. For example, on weekdays, demand may increase during rush hours, but on weekends and holidays, different demand patterns may occur. It's important to incorporate these variations into your predictive model.
2. Weather conditions: Weather conditions play an important role in influencing the demand for bicycles. Factors such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed can affect the willingness to rent a bike. Incorporating weather data into forecast models improves accuracy. 3. Special Events and Holidays: Special events, festivals and holidays can have a significant impact on urban bicycle demand. For example, large sporting events, concerts, and festivals can result in crowds and increased use of bicycles. It is important to consider such events to avoid underestimating or overestimating demand.
Four. Spatial variation: Demand for bicycles can vary by area of ​​a city. Factors such as population density, transportation hubs, and proximity to popular travel destinations can influence demand behavior. Spatial analysis techniques can be used to capture and explain these variations.
Data analysis techniques for predicting demand for bicycles:

 To overcome the above challenges, various data analysis techniques can be used to predict bicycle demand. Here are some commonly used techniques:

 1. Time series analysis: Time series analysis is a statistical technique focused on studying patterns and trends in data collected over time. It can be used to analyze historical bike rental data to identify underlying patterns and seasonality. Models such as autoregressive integrated moving averages and exponential smoothing are commonly used for time series forecasting.
2. Machine Learning Models: Machine learning techniques provide powerful tools for predicting bicycle demand. Regression models such as linear regression and decision trees can be used to understand the relationship between demand and various factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and events. More advanced machine learning models such as gradient boosting algorithms (such as XGBoost) and neural networks (such as LSTM) can capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships in data.
3. Spatial Analysis: Spatial analysis techniques can be used to incorporate spatial variability into the model to predict demand for bicycles. These techniques can improve the accuracy of regional-level forecasts by taking into account geographic factors such as population density, distance to transportation hubs, and popular destinations. 4. Integrating weather data: Integrating weather data into the bicycle demand forecasting model will greatly improve accuracy. Combining historical and real-time weather data such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed and humidity with bike rental data allows you to see correlations and understand weather-dependent demand patterns.
4. Model development, training, and validation:

 Once the data has been preprocessed and features extracted, the next step is to develop a predictive model. This typically involves splitting the data into training and validation sets. The training set is used to train the predictive model and the validation set is used to evaluate its performance.
Explore a variety of models, including traditional statistical models (such as ARIMA), regression models, decision trees, ensemble methods, and neural networks. The choice of model depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the bicycle demand data. During model training, hyperparameters (learning rate, regularization parameter, etc.) are adjusted to optimize model performance. Cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation can be used to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.
